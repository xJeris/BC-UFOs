# US UFO Sightings Data

## Overview
This analysis creates a searchable web page that has data on UFO sightings in the United States. A user can search using any combination of available criteria to narrow their results.

## Results
Initially all UFO data results will be displayed. When a user enters a value in one of the search criteria on the left side of the page and hits enter it will filter the table of information on the right. You can see in the below example, the data has been filtered to only include the state of Oregon, using its abbreviation.

If the filter criteria is cleared and you hit enter, it will display all of the result data.

## Summary
This results filter could be improved to offer more search flexibility and display options. One drawback it has currently, is that there is no way to sort the results by column heading (e.g. Date, City, etc.). Additionally, the search criteria are case-sensitive.

I would recommend the following improvements for the next iteration of this web page.
* Make the results headings sortable.
* Updated the search criteria fields so that they are not case-sensitive.
